# 📚 SEMESTER III | ACADEMIC MATERIALS

Welcome to the place where the third semester sanity went to die.

This repository is a comprehensive collection of all academic materials, lectures, methodological guides, and laboratory works for the **Mathematics and Computer Science (MKN)** track at **Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU)**.

### What's Inside?
- **C++:** Labs, practice code, and final project foundations.
- **Python:** Assignments and scripts.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** Theory and implementation examples.
- **Discrete Math & TAU:** Homework and calculation tasks.

Feel free to explore, but use the code with caution—it was written under extreme caffeine deficit.
